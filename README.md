Snake Game Project (Using Python and PyGame)

- Designed and implemented a fully functional **Snake Game** using Python and the PyGame library.  
- Developed dynamic game mechanics, including real-time snake movement, food spawning, and body growth.  
- Incorporated user input handling for seamless direction control using keyboard inputs (W/A/S/D or arrow keys).  
- Created features for game-over conditions such as collision with boundaries or the snake's body.  
- Added a scoring system to display the player's score dynamically during gameplay.  
- Implemented adjustable difficulty levels by controlling the snake's movement speed.  
- Utilized PyGame for rendering graphical elements like the snake, food, and background, ensuring smooth frame transitions.  
- Focused on modular code structure and optimized logic for performance and maintainability.  

This project showcases your programming skills, ability to handle real-time events, and expertise in game development with Python and PyGame.
